SKIN DISEASE PREDICTION AND CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS

Skin diseases are very common for humans in day-to-day lives. The task of recognizing the
type of skin disease and prediction of its occurrence is the most complicated one as we have
hundreds of varieties of skin textures and different visual closeness effects of diseases and other
factors. Therefore, it is of high importance to detect the occurrence of any skin disease and
also, we should be able to find the type of skin disease to get best treatment.
The proposed system focuses on building the model for the prediction and classification
analysis of different types of skin diseases using deep learning techniques and algorithms.
These deep learning algorithms help the model in predicting and classifying the skin diseases
on different characteristics of the dataset with more accuracy.
